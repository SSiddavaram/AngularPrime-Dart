AngularPrime-Dart
=================

AngularPrime-Dart is a Dart port of Rudy de Busscher's AngularPrime component library.

The goal of the project is to provide
<ul>
<li>A similar (maybe even identical) API as the original AngularPrime.</li>
<li>A Dart widget library blending seamlessly into the PrimeFaces look and feel</li>
<li>and that's even compatible to the JSF version of PrimeFaces.</li>
<li>Ultimately, AngularPrime-Dart is going to be used as the widget library of AngularFaces (unless technical obstacles arise).</li>
</ul> 

<b>Current state of the art:</b>
The project is in it's nascient state. Development takes place in the "experimental" packages until
the sources become more mature.
